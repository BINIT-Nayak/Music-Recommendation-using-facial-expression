# Music Recommendation using Facial Expression

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Music Recommender using Facial Expressions project! This innovative project aims to create a unique and engaging music recommendation system that leverages facial expressions to understand user emotions and preferences.

## About the Project

This Python app recommends music based on facial expressions. Key features include:

- **Facial Expression Analysis:** Utilizes computer vision techniques and facial expression recognition models to capture and analyze users' facial expressions.
- **Emotion Mapping to Music:** Maps facial expressions to corresponding emotional states, recommending music that aligns with the user's mood.
- **Music Database:** Offers a diverse and extensive music database covering various genres, artists, and moods.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Implements a feedback loop for users to rate recommended music, enhancing the accuracy and personalization of recommendations.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Uses machine learning algorithms to continuously improve music preference predictions.
- **User Interface (UI):** Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for real-time music suggestions based on captured facial expressions.

## Built With

- **Python:** Core programming language for the application.
- **OpenCV:** Computer vision library for facial expression analysis.
- **Keras:** Deep learning library for building and training the facial expression recognition model.
